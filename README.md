## General info
- Board size is 3X3.
- The player chooses where to mark his sign by entering coordinates of the board(x,y).
	
## Technologies
* java SE17
* java utilities library


## Features
- Player can choose 3 game modes:
  1. Human player VS another human player.
  2. Human player VS CPU
  3. CPU VS CPU

- Mr.Whatever, he just mark his sign randomly.(CPU)
- Mrs.Clever, a little bit smarter than Mr.Whatever, she has a basic algorithm for decision making.(CPU)

- 2 option for screen rendering:
  1. Void print - it just won't print anything on screen except the result of the tournament(it saves time if you put a cpu player against a cpu player).
  2. Console renderer - it's showing everything on screen without skipping.

* Mrs.Clever is compatible for board size of 3X3 only, maybe in the future i will make her compatible with any board size and smarter.
